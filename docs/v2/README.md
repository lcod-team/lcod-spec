# LCOD v2 Exploration

This folder collects design sketches, diagrams, and notes for a v2 architecture focused on KISS principles.

## Goals
- Express compose logic naturally (minimal `out`/plumbing) while keeping traceability.
- Describe subsystems (run-compose, resolver, scope lookup, etc.) with Mermaid diagrams and drill-down sections.
- Iterate quickly without impacting current v1 behavior.

## Structure
- `overview.md` – high-level modules diagram.
- `subsystems/` – per-area breakdown (resolver, runtime, tooling, etc.).
- `playground/` – experimental snippets / prototypes.

Feel free to add new sketches; keep each file focused and reference diagrams from the overview for easy navigation.
