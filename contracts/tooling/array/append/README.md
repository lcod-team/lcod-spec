# lcod://contract/tooling/array/append@1.0.0

Append one or more values to an array with optional fallbacks.

## Notes

Takes an initial array and returns a new array with the provided value(s)
appended. Accepts either a single `value` or a list of `values`; both can be
omitted. The contract also reports the resulting length.
