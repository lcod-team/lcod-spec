[documentation]
body = """
This contract allows a compose to execute one of its own slots (or a slot from a
nested component) without relying on scripting. The host runtime forwards the
request to the same slot machinery that powers `flow/if`, `flow/foreach`, etc.

Typical usage:

```yaml
- call: lcod://contract/compose/run_slot@1
  in:
    slot: target
  out:
    result: targetResult
  slots:
    target:
      - call: lcod://impl/set@1
        in:
          result:
            value: $.input
```

By default the contract forwards the current scope (`$`) to the slot. When a
custom state is provided, it is cloned before execution so the slot can mutate
it freely. Optional `slotVars` mirror the values kernels pass to built-in flow
controls (phase, error, ...).

Runtimes SHOULD return the slot's output untouched in `result`. When the slot is
missing and the call is marked as `optional`, implementations may simply report
`ran = false` without raising an error.
