# tooling/resolver/register_components

Registers shared resolver helper components (registry loaders, selectors, and resolver utilities) with the runtime. The component expects a `specRoot` pointing to the `lcod-spec` repository and calls the `tooling/resolver/register@1` axiom to publish each compose.
