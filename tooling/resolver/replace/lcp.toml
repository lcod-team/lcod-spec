Utility component that resolves the effective component identifier according to the resolver configuration:

- walks the `replaceAlias` map until it finds a terminal id or encounters a cycle;
- if a specific override is present in `replaceSpec`, returns it alongside the resolved id;
- reports misconfigurations (missing id, alias cycles) through the accumulated warnings.

This helper keeps the replacement logic reusable across resolver flows and easy to unit test."""
