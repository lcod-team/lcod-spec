# Registry Entry Selector (`tooling/registry/select@0.1.0`)

Given a registry packages map (as produced by `tooling/registry/index@0.1.0`), this
component selects the best matching component entry for a requested id and
version constraint.

It understands a subset of Semantic Versioning:

- exact versions (`1.2.3`)
- caret ranges (`^1.2.0`)
- tilde ranges (`~1.4.0`)
- wildcard suffixes (`1.2.x`, `1.x`)
- `*` / `latest`

## Inputs

```json
{
  "packages": {
    "lcod://demo/catalog": [
      { "version": "1.2.0", "registryId": "official", ... }
    ]
  },
  "id": "lcod://demo/catalog",
  "range": "^1.0.0",
  "registryId": "official"
}
```

## Outputs

```json
{
  "entry": {
    "version": "1.2.0",
    "registryId": "official",
    "manifest": "packages/demo/catalog/1.2.0/manifest.json"
  }
}
```

If no suitable entry is found the component returns `{ "entry": null }`.
