# lcod://tooling/compose/normalize@0.1.0

Normalize sugar syntax in compose definitions before execution.

## Notes

Expands author-friendly shortcuts (“sugar”) into the canonical compose shape consumed by LCOD kernels.

## Behaviour Overview

| Concern | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Identity & optional keys | Collapse `foo: $.foo`/`foo: foo` boilerplate and allow opt-in omission via `key?`. |
| Spreads | Merge whole objects with `...` shorthands instead of enumerating keys. |
| Children | Normalize slot collections so every branch is handled consistently. |

The component accepts an object with a `compose` array and returns the normalized version. Kernels call it before executing any flow so that reviewers see the short form, while runtimes always deal with the fully expanded structure.

### Example

Input (author-friendly sugar):

```yaml
compose:
  - call: lcod://impl/echo@1
    in:
      '...': $.payload
      'configPath?': =
      value: =
    out:
      result: =
```

Output (canonical form consumed by kernels):

```yaml
compose:
  - call: lcod://impl/echo@1
    in:
      __lcod_spreads__:
        - source: '$.payload'
      configPath:
        __lcod_optional__: true
        value: '$.configPath'
      value: '$.value'
    out:
      result: result
```

## Supported Sugar Rules

1. **Identity mappings** – `foo: '='` ⇢ `foo: '$.foo'`, `bar: '='` ⇢ `bar: 'bar'`.
2. **Optional keys** – append `?` (`configPath?: '='`) to skip mappings when the referenced path is absent.
3. **Spreads** – use `...` to merge objects: `...: $.payload`, `...lock: '='`, or pass descriptors (`...: { source: $.payload, pick: ['path','data'] }`).
4. **Slots** – ensure every slot appears under `slots: { name: [...] }`. Legacy `children` shorthands are still expanded for backwards compatibility but should be avoided in new comps.
5. **Nested structures** – sugar only applies at the top-level, ensuring inner objects/arrays remain untouched.

The component emits reserved markers to describe these constructs in canonical form:

- `__lcod_spreads__`: array of descriptors `{ source, optional?, pick? }`.
- `__lcod_optional__`: wraps values that should be omitted when unresolved.

These behaviours mirror the helpers that previously lived in each kernel, keeping the ecosystem consistent.

## Implementation Notes

- The component is implemented via `lcod://tooling/script@1`, so kernels can execute it directly.
- No external imports are required; a simple deep-clone helper preserves plain JSON objects.

## Runtime Integration

- `lcod-kernel-js` and `lcod-kernel-rs` invoke this component before executing any compose (CLI included).
- `LCOD_SPEC_PATH` permet de pointer vers une spec alternative ; sinon, les kernels retombent sur le repo adjacent.
- If execution fails, kernels still keep a legacy normalizer to stay functional.

## Roadmap

- Optional defaults (e.g. `foo?: value('fallback')`) to combine omission with explicit fallback values.
- Output spreads (e.g. `...: $slot.error`) to simplify error handlers and similar pass-through slots.
- Slot metadata helpers around `collectPath` to declutter complex flows.

The shared component keeps these improvements aligned across documentation, fixtures, and runtimes while authors continue to write in the concise format.
