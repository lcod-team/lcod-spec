# Test: foreach_ctrl_demo expectation

Runs the `examples/flow/foreach_ctrl_demo` compose through the
`tooling/test_checker@1` contract. The test feeds the same input as the demo and
expects the loop to collect `[1, 3]`.

This fixture is intended to be consumed by runtimes (Node, Rust, â€¦) so they all
share the exact same assertions.
