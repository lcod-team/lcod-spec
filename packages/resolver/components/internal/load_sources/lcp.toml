body = """
Loads a resolver `sources.json`, fetches the referenced catalogues, and emits
registry source records that the existing registry tooling can consume.

The component understands pointer entries served over `file`, `http(s)` and
`git` transports. Pointer payloads may either be:

- `lcod-registry/catalogues@1` (catalogue of catalogues) which is expanded
  recursively.
- `lcod-registry/catalogue@1` listing components and versions.

Each concrete catalogue is converted into an inline source with the same shape
as the legacy `registry.sources` configuration so downstream steps can reuse
`tooling/registry/source/load@0.1.0` unchanged."""
